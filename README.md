## Usage

The application consists of two main components: `NewsArea` and `NewsItem`. The `NewsArea` component fetches data from the news API and passes the article data to the `NewsItem` component, which displays each article in a card format.

## Components

- **NewsArea**: Fetches news data from the API and maps each article to a `NewsItem` component.
- **NewsItem**: Displays the details of a single news article including the title, description, and an image.

## CSS

The CSS for this project is managed through a combination of Bootstrap classes and custom styles defined in the `App.css` file. Each card is styled to be responsive and visually appealing.
